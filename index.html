    <h1>INHERITANCE AND PROTOTYPE</h1>
    <h3>Q1.Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object using
        parents prototype</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        // Parent object constructor
        function Parent(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        
        // Method attached to Parent object's prototype
        Parent.prototype.greet = function() {
          console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }
        
        // Child object constructor
        function Child(name) {
          Parent.call(this, name);
        }
        
        // Inherit from Parent object's prototype
        Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
        
        // Create new instance of Child object
        const child = new Child('John');
        
        // Call method from Parent object's prototype on Child object
        child.greet();

        //output- Hello, my name is John
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, we create a Parent object constructor which accepts a name parameter, and sets it as a property on
        the object using this.name = name;. We also attach a greet method to the Parent object's prototype.

        Next, we create a Child object constructor, which calls the Parent constructor using Parent.call(this, name); to
        set the name property on the Child object.

        Then, we use Object.create to inherit from the Parent object's prototype, which allows the Child object to
        access the greet method attached to the Parent object's prototype.

        Finally, we create a new instance of the Child object with the name "John", and call the greet method on it. The
        greet method is executed with the context of the Child object, but because it was inherited from the Parent
        object's prototype, it has access to the name property on the Child object.

    <h3>Q2.Write code to explain prototype chaining</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        // Parent object constructor
        function Parent(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        
        // Method attached to Parent object's prototype
        Parent.prototype.greet = function() {
          console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }
        
        // Child object constructor
        function Child(name, age) {
          Parent.call(this, name);
          this.age = age;
        }
        
        // Inherit from Parent object's prototype
        Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
        
        // Method attached to Child object's prototype
        Child.prototype.describe = function() {
          console.log(`I am ${this.age} years old`);
        }
        
        // Create new instance of Child object
        const child = new Child('John', 5);
        
        // Call method from Parent object's prototype on Child object
        child.greet();
        
        // Call method from Child object's prototype on Child object
        child.describe();

        //output- Hello, my name is John
                  I am 5 years old
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, we have a Parent object constructor with a greet method attached to its prototype. We also have a
        Child object constructor that calls the Parent constructor using Parent.call(this, name); to set the name
        property on the Child object. The Child object's prototype is set to Object.create(Parent.prototype), which
        inherits the greet method from the Parent object's prototype.

        We also attach a describe method to the Child object's prototype.

        When we create a new instance of the Child object with the name "John" and age of 5, we can call both the greet
        method from the Parent object's prototype and the describe method from the Child object's prototype on the child
        object.

        This demonstrates how objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototype, and how prototype
        chaining allows for inheritance to occur across multiple levels of objects.

    <h3>Q3.Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate sum
        for multiple arrays</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        // Add method to calculate sum of all elements in Array's prototype
        Array.prototype.sum = function() {
          return this.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
        }
        
        // Create multiple arrays
        const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const arr2 = [10, 20, 30];
        const arr3 = [100, 200, 300, 400];
        
        // Use the sum method to calculate the sum for each array
        console.log(arr1.sum()); // Output: 15
        console.log(arr2.sum()); // Output: 60
        console.log(arr3.sum()); // Output: 1000
        
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, we add a method named sum to the Array object's prototype using the Array.prototype syntax. The
        sum method uses the reduce method to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

        We then create multiple arrays named arr1, arr2, and arr3. We use the sum method to calculate the sum of all
        elements in each array.

    <h3>Q4.Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        function getAllPropertyNames(obj) {
            // Create an array to store property names
            const props = [];
            
            // Get own property names and add them to the props array
            const ownProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj);
            props.push(...ownProps);
          
            // Get the object's prototype
            const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
          
            // If the prototype is not null, recursively call this function on it
            if (proto !== null) {
              const inheritedProps = getAllPropertyNames(proto);
              props.push(...inheritedProps);
            }
          
            // Return the props array
            return props;
          }
          
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        The function getAllPropertyNames takes an object as an argument, and recursively retrieves all the property
        names of the object's own properties and inherited properties.

        We start by creating an empty array props to store the property names. We use the Object.getOwnPropertyNames
        method to get the object's own property names, and add them to the props array using the spread operator (...).

        We then use the Object.getPrototypeOf method to get the object's prototype. If the prototype is not null, we
        recursively call the getAllPropertyNames function on it and add the inherited property names to the props array.

        Finally, we return the props array, which contains all the names of the object's own and inherited properties.
